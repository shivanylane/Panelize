Panelize
========

PCB Panelization program
Panelize was created to allow PCB engineers and designers an easy graphical way to determine how many PC boards will 
fit on a panel given a PC board size.

It returns values and graphics for the three common panel sizes: full, half and third and 
two orientations: horizontal and vertical. You can then continue to adjust the size of the board for optimal panel use.
